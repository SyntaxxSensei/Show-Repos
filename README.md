# Documentation

To use this package, you need to have a file called show-repos.settings.json in your documents folder.

This is not editable for now, but in future it will be.

The contents of the file needs to be the below:

```JSON
{
    "includeDirectories": [
        "C:\\Users\\username\\source"
    ]
}
```
